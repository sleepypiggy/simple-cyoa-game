# Simple Choose Your Own Adventure Game

I made this a while ago for a high school class so I honestly don't remember much about it.

## Instructions

On menu screen, press 'A' on keyboard to start, 'B' to close the program. Each decision can be made by clicking either of the two keys on the keyboard.

Occasionally, upon entering a new room, a popup will appear telling you that you have to click a key on the keyboard from A-Z within a certain timeframe otherwise you'll lose.

There are multiple ways to lose and multiple ways to win. Press 'r' to restart game is over.
